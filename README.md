# Datawire Vert.x 3.0 Microservice Cookiecutter

Provides the basic project structure for developing a microservice that uses Java and the [Vert.x 3.0](http://vertx.io) framework.

# Usage

1. Ensure you have the `cookiecutter` program installed: `pip install cookiecutter`. Documentation for Cookiecutter can be found on the [Cookiecutter](https://pages.github.com/) repository.
2. Run `cookiecutter gh:datawire/cookiecutter-vertx` and answer the prompts. Beyond changing `name` most default values should be sane.
